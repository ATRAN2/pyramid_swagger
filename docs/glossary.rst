Glossary of Terms
===========================================

Nothing more than some common vocabulary for you to absorb.

swagger api-docs (often swagger api)
  The preferred term for the resource listing and associated api declarations. This is so-named to avoid confusion with the Swagger Specification and the actual implementation of your service.

resource listing
  The top-level declaration of the various Swagger resources your service exposes. Each resource must have an associated api declaration.

api declaration
  The description of each endpoint a particular Swagger service provides, with complete input and output declared.

swagger spec
  The formal specification of a valid swagger api. The current public version is 2.0 and hosted on `wordnik's Github <https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md>`_.
